<div class="servicesmain"> <h3>Biomedical Databases</h3>
<fieldset>
<ol><li> <p>OMIM
<a href = " https://www.omim.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
Online Mendelian Inheritance In Man (OMIM) is a public database of bibliographic information about human genes and genetic disorders</p></li>
<li><p>COSMIC
<a href = " https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic "  >link!
</a><br>
COSMIC, the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer, is the world's largest and most comprehensive resource for exploring the impact of somatic mutations in human cancer.</p></li>
<li><p>NCDB
<a href = " https://www.facs.org/quality-programs/cancer/ncdb "  >link!
</a><br>
National Cancer Database (NCDB)jointly sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer Society is a clinical oncology database sourced from hospital registry data that are collected in more than 1,500 Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>TCGA
<a href = "https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/"  >link!
</a><br>
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. </p></li>
<li><p>GEO 
<a href = " https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"  >link!
</a><br>
GEO is a public functional genomics data repository supporting MIAME-compliant data submissions. Array- and sequence-based data are accepted. Tools are provided to help users query and download experiments and curated gene expression profiles.</p></li>
<li><p>DGV 
<a href = " http://dgv.tcag.ca/dgv/app/home "  >link!
</a><br>
The objective of the Database of Genomic Variants is to provide a comprehensive summary of structural variation in the human genome. DGV define structural variation as genomic alterations that involve segments of DNA that are larger than 50bp. The content of the database is only representing structural variation identified in healthy control sampless</p></li>
<li><p>DECIPHER
<a href = " https://www.deciphergenomics.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
DECIPHER (DatabasE of genomiC varIation and Phenotype in Humans using Ensembl Resources) is an interactive web-based database which incorporates a suite of tools designed to aid the interpretation of genomic variants.

DECIPHER enhances clinical diagnosis by retrieving information from a variety of bioinformatics resources relevant to the variant found in the patient. The patient's variant is displayed in the context of both normal variation and pathogenic variation reported at that locus thereby facilitating interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>CTD
<a href = " http://ctdbase.org/about/;jsessionid=D67D8282CF0091069561C0100630F89E "  >link!
</a><br>
CTD is a robust, publicly available database that aims to advance understanding about how environmental exposures affect human health. It provides manually curated information about chemical gene/protein interactions, chemical disease and gene disease relationships. These data are integrated with functional and pathway data to aid in development of hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying environmentally influenced diseases.</p></li>
<li><p>CLINVAR 
<a href = " https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ "  >link!
</a><br>
ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting evidence. ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status, and the history of that interpretation. </p></li>
<li><p>NCBI 
<a href = " https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is part of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM), a branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is approved and funded by the government of the United States</p></li>
