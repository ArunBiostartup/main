<fieldset>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Brassica.info 
<a href = " https://brassica.info/ "  >link!
</a><br>
This site collates and exchanges open source information relating to Brassica genomics and genetics, on behalf of the Multinational Brassica Genome Project (MBGP).
</p></li><li>
<p>ENSEMBLE Plants 
<a href = "https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html "  >link!
</a><br>
Ensembl Plants is an integrative resource presenting genome-scale information for 39 sequenced plant species. Available data includes genome sequence, gene models, functional annotation, and polymorphic loci; for the latter, additional information including population structure, individual genotypes, linkage, and phenotype data is available for some species. Comparative data is also available, including genomic alignments and "gene trees," which show the inferred evolutionary history of each gene family represented in the resource
</p></li><li>
<p>Genome Size in Asteraceae Database 
<a href = "https://www.asteraceaegenomesize.com/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The GSAD aims to make all genome size data for Asteraceae easily and widely accessible, in a user-friendly internet database. The GSAD is an exhaustive catalogue of genome size data for the family Asteraceae. Genome sizes are now available for 1,555 species based on 4,350 records from 198 publications released until July 2018. 
</p></li><li>
<p>NCBI 
<a href = " https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/ "  >link!
</a><br>
This resource organizes information on genomes including sequences, maps, chromosomes, assemblies, and annotations.
</p></li><li>
<p>PGDJ DNA Marker and Linkage Database 
<a href = "http://pgdbj.jp/plantdb/plantdblink.html?ln=en "  >link!
</a><br>
 Plant Genome DataBase Japan is a website that integrates a variety of information related to genomes of model and crop plants from databases (DBs) and the literature. 
</p></li><li>
<p>Phytozome
<a href = "https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/ "  >link!
</a><br>
Phytozome, provides a centralized hub that enables users with varying degrees of computational sophistication to access annotated plant gene families, to navigate the evolutionary history of gene families and individual genes, to examine plant genes in their genomic context, to assign putative function to uncharacterized user sequences and provides uniform access to plant genomics data sets consisting of complete genomes, gene and related (e.g. homologous) sequences and alignments, gene functional information and gene families, either in bulk or as the result of on-the-fly complex queries.
</p></li><li>
<p>Plant DNA C-values Database 
<a href = " https://cvalues.science.kew.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>

The Plant DNA C-values Database is a comprehensive catalogue of C-value (nuclear DNA content, or in diploids, genome size) data for land plants and algae.
</p></li><li>
<p>Plant RDNA Database 
<a href = " https://www.plantrdnadatabase.com/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The Plant rDNA database ( www.plantrdnadatabase.com ) is an online and open access resource providing information about the numbers, positions and organization of ribosomal DNA lociin plant species based on data reported in published papers on plant molecular cytogenetics. It now includes information from papers already published or in press up to June 2013 on angiosperms, gymnosperms, bryophytes and, for the first time, on pteridophytes. 
</p></li><li>
<p>Plant GDB Genome Browser 
<a href = "http://www.plantgdb.org/prj/GenomeBrowser/ "  >link!
</a><br>
For plant species with ongoing genome sequencing projects, PlantGDB provides genome browsers to display current gene structure models and transcript evidence from spliced alignments of EST and cDNA sequences.
</p></li><li>
<p>PRG-Wiki 
<a href = " http://prgdb.crg.eu/wiki/Main_Page "  >link!
</a><br>
PRG-Wiki is an open and daily update space about plant resistance gene, in which all information about this family is stored, curated and discussed. PRG-Wiki actually stores more than 112 reference resistance gene and 104335 putative disease resistance gene.
</p></li><li>
<p>JSTOR 
<a href = " https://plants.jstor.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
Global Plants is the worldï¿½s largest database of digitized plant specimens and a locus for international scientific research and collaboration.
</p></li><li>
<p>Garden.org 
<a href = " https://garden.org/plants/ "  >link!
</a><br>
There are 759,236 plants, and 698,099 images in this world class database of plants, which is collaboratively developed by over 4,000 Garden.org members from around the globe.
</p></li><li>
<p>GreeNC
<a href = " http://greenc.sequentiabiotech.com/wiki/Main_Page "  >link!
</a><br>
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are functional non-translated molecules longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse roles, such as chromatin modifications, transcriptional regulation, and conformational changes in proteins. The Green Non-Coding Database (GreeNC) is a repository of lncRNAs annotated in plants and algae.
