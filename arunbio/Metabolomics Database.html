<div class="servicesmain"> <h3>Metabolomics Databases</h3>
<fieldset>
<ol>
<li>
<p>KEGG 
<a href = " https://www.genome.jp/kegg/ "  >link!
</a><br>
KEGG is a database resource for understanding high-level functions and utilities of the biological system, such as the cell, the organism and the ecosystem, from molecular-level information, especially large-scale molecular datasets generated by genome sequencing and other high-throughput experimental technologies.
</p></li><li>
<p>REACTOME 
<a href = " https://reactome.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
REACTOME is an open-source, open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database.Reactome is a freely available, open source relational database of signaling and metabolic molecules and their relations organized into biological pathways and processes. 
</p></li><li>
<p>BioCyC 
<a href = " https://www.biocyc.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The BioCyc database collection is an assortment of organism specific Pathway/Genome Databases (PGDBs) that provide reference to genome and metabolic pathway information for thousands of organisms.
</p></li><li>
<p>HMDB 
<a href = " https://hmdb.ca/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) is a freely available electronic database containing detailed information about small molecule metabolites found in the human body. It contains experimental MS/MS data for over 5,700 compounds, experimental 1 H and 13 C NMR data (and assignments) for over 1,300 compounds and GC/MS spectral and retention index data for more than 780 compounds.
</p></li><li>
<p>BRENDA 
<a href = " https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
BRENDA represents a comprehensive relational database containing all enzymes classified according to the EC system of the Enzyme Nomenclature Committee (IUBMB). This classification is based on the type of reaction (e.g. oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, group transfer) catalysed by the enzyme. It covers organism-specific information on functional and molecular properties, enzyme names, catalysed reaction, occurrence, sequence, kinetics, substrates/products, inhibitors, cofactors, activators, structure and stability.
</p></li><li>
<p>GMD 
<a href = " http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) is a gas chromatography (GC) ï¿½ mass spectrometry (MS) reference library dedicated to metabolite profiling experiments and comprises mass spectral and retention index (RI) information for non-annotated mass spectral tags (MSTs, mass spectral information with retention time attached indices) together with data of a multitude of already identified metabolites and reference substances.
</p></li><li>
<p>SMPDB 
<a href = " https://smpdb.ca/ "  >link!
</a><br>
SMPDB (The Small Molecule Pathway Database) is an interactive, visual database containing more than 30 000 small molecule pathways found in humans only. SMPDB is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and systems biology.
</p></li><li>
<p>ExoCarta 
<a href = " http://exocarta.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
Exosomes are 30-150 nm membrane vesicles of endocytic origin secreted by most cell types in vitro. ExoCarta, an exosome database, provides with the contents that were identified in exosomes in multiple organisms.
