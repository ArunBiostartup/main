<div class="servicesmain"> <h3>Interactions Databases</h3>
<fieldset>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IntAct
<a href = " https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/home "  >link!
</a><br>
IntAct provides a free, open source database system and analysis tools for molecular interaction data. All interactions are derived from literature curation or direct user submissions.
</p></li><li>
<p>BioGRID 
<a href = " https://thebiogrid.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The BioGRID (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets, thebiogrid.org) is an open-access database resource that houses manually curated protein and genetic interactions from multiple species including yeast, worm, fly, mouse, and human.
</p></li><li>
<p>CHEMBL 
<a href = " https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ "  >link!
</a><br>
ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs.
</p></li><li>
<p>STITCH 
<a href = " http://stitch.embl.de/"  >link!
</a><br>
STITCH is a resource to explore known and predicted interactions of chemicals and proteins. Chemicals are linked to other chemicals and proteins by evidence derived from experiments, databases and the literature. STITCH contains interactions for between 300,000 small molecules and 2.6 million proteins from 1133 organisms.
</p></li><li>
<p>DrugBank 
<a href = " https://go.drugbank.com/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The DrugBank database is a unique bioinformatics and cheminformatics resource that combines detailed drug (i.e. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical) data with comprehensive drug target (i.e. sequence, structure, and pathway) information.
</p></li><li>
<p>DIP 
<a href = " https://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/dip/Main.cgi "  >link!
</a><br>
The DIPdatabase catalogs experimentally determined interactions between proteins. It combines information from a variety of sources to create a single, consistent set of protein-protein interactions. The data stored within the DIP database were curated, both, manually by expert curators and also automatically using computational approaches that utilize the the knowledge about the protein-protein interaction networks extracted from the most reliable, core subset of the DIP data.
</p></li><li>
<p>STRING 
<a href = " https://string-db.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
STRING is a database of known and predicted protein-protein interactions. The interactions include direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations; they stem from computational prediction, from knowledge transfer between organisms, and from interactions aggregated from other (primary) databases
</p></li><li>
<p>Human Protein Reference Database 
<a href = " http://www.hprd.org/ "  >link!
</a><br>
The Human Protein Reference Database represents a centralized platform to visually depict and integrate information pertaining to domain architecture, post-translational modifications, interaction networks and disease association for each protein in the human proteome.
